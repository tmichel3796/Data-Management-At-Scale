Thank you for checking out my project. This is a great  example of how I code with data management practices in mind. 

There's a few points to keep in mind  when reading through  these files.
- This was a Final Project for a a class that teaches about how to process large data sets, and the main point of this project was showing my skills with  managing those  data  sets. 
- As such you may find that the metrics I create are a little bit over simplified and in the end my model is of mediocre quality.
-  The data is pretty large so I opted to not  include it in my git hub. However, if you wish to download the original dataset you can do so by following the directions in Lab1.
- The teacher provided questions in markdown cells throughout the document. However, to explain my thought process, I also left comments  throughout the code Anything in markdown was written by the teacher. 

The project was  broken out into 6 parts. 
- Lab 1 and 2 go into detail on how I explore data.
- Labs 3 and 4 show how I process large data sets using lazy evaluation, and write them into a compressed Parquet file which compresses the data
- Lab 5 Show's the creation of a few metrics which will be fed into machine learning algorithms in Lab 6
- Lab 6 Is where the final analysis is conducted. I have provided a copy of the finished data in the data file in case you wish to run this document and  see just this Lab run.
